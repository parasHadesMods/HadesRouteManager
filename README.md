# Hades Route Manager

Manage a tree of Hades savestates representing a route.

For now, the hades save path for Mac is hardcoded, but you can fix it by editing HADES_SAVE_PATH.

## To use the text interface

python routemanager.py

## To use the graphical interface (requires tkinter)

python gui.py
